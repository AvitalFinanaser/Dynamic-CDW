There are currently no proposals in the system.
TASK: Based on the system state and your profile, you must decide your next action through the following reasoning steps.
You are expected to propose the first action for the community.. Be very concise when addressing each step.
**Step 1: Situation Analysis**
- Analyze the current proposals in the system, sub-topics, their vote counts, and **your own voting stance**.
- Note which paragraphs are **included** in the current document and which are not.
- Identify which topics are over-represented (repeated ideas), under-represented (missing themes), or unbalanced (too extreme or vague).
**Step 2: Position Alignment**
- Evaluate if paragraphs included in the document reflect your profile and position.
- Identify proposals or included content that you support or oppose, and consider whether they align with your background and orientation.
- Is there a critical gap in themes, sub-topics, or emphasis that makes the document feel incomplete or unbalanced from your perspective?
**Step 3: Decision Evaluation**
- Evaluate whether proposing a new action or voting on an existing proposal would be the best way to influence the document at this point.
- If your position on a proposal has weakened from previous vote (*own vote is not ?*), explicitly choose ABSTAIN to reflect uncertainty or neutrality.
- Determine the optimal strategic action: propose a new paragraph / vote on an existing one, to best align the document with your values.
**Step 4: Action Formulation**
If PROPOSE: Formulate a new proposal that:
- Addresses a sub-topic important to your background
- Contains a practical, realistic, diverse action suggestion (max 20 words)
- Aligns with these examples of your position:

TASK: Based on the system state and your profile, you must decide your next action through the following reasoning steps.
You can either PROPOSE a new action or VOTE on an existing proposal. Be very concise when addressing each step.
**Step 1: Situation Analysis**
- Analyze the current proposals in the system, sub-topics, their vote counts, and **your own voting stance**.
- Note which paragraphs are **included** in the current document and which are not.
- Identify which topics are over-represented (repeated ideas), under-represented (missing themes), or unbalanced (too extreme or vague).
**Step 2: Position Alignment**
- Evaluate if paragraphs included in the document reflect your profile and position.
- Identify proposals or included content that you support or oppose, and consider whether they align with your background and orientation.
- Is there a critical gap in themes, sub-topics, or emphasis that makes the document feel incomplete or unbalanced from your perspective?
**Step 3: Decision Evaluation**
- Evaluate whether proposing a new action or voting on an existing proposal would be the best way to influence the document at this point.
- If your position on a proposal has weakened from previous vote (*own vote is not ?*), explicitly choose ABSTAIN to reflect uncertainty or neutrality.
- Determine the optimal strategic action: propose a new paragraph / vote on an existing one, to best align the document with your values.
**Step 4: Action Formulation**
If PROPOSE: Formulate a new proposal that:
- Addresses a sub-topic important to your background

TASK: Based on the system state and your profile, you must decide your next action through the following reasoning steps.
You can either PROPOSE a new action or VOTE on an existing proposal. Be very concise when addressing each step.
**Step 1: Situation Analysis**
- Analyze the current proposals in the system, sub-topics, their vote counts, and **your own voting stance**.
- Note which paragraphs are **included** in the current document and which are not.
- Identify which topics are over-represented (repeated ideas), under-represented (missing themes), or unbalanced (too extreme or vague).
**Step 2: Position Alignment**
- Evaluate if paragraphs included in the document reflect your profile and position.
- Identify proposals or included content that you support or oppose, and consider whether they align with your background and orientation.
- Is there a critical gap in themes, sub-topics, or emphasis that makes the document feel incomplete or unbalanced from your perspective?
**Step 3: Decision Evaluation**
- Evaluate whether proposing a new action or voting on an existing proposal would be the best way to influence the document at this point.
- If your position on a proposal has weakened from previous vote (*own vote is not ?*), explicitly choose ABSTAIN to reflect uncertainty or neutrality.
- Determine the optimal strategic action: propose a new paragraph / vote on an existing one, to best align the document with your values.
**Step 4: Action Formulation**
If PROPOSE: Formulate a new proposal that:
- Addresses a sub-topic important to your background
- Contains a practical, realistic, diverse action suggestion (max 20 words)
- Aligns with these examples of your position:
EXAMPLES OF ACTIONS SIMILAR TO YOUR POSITION:
1. [Natural Hazards] Consider both historical data and climate projections equally in hazard planning. (Reasoning: Balances traditional and forward-looking risk assessment)
2. [Energy] Maintain current energy mix with gradual adoption of renewables based on market prices. (Reasoning: Neutral approach following market trends)
3. [Water] Consider both water conservation and operational convenience equally in facility management. (Reasoning: Balances efficiency with practical considerations without prioritizing either)
If VOTE: Choose a paragraph and indicate clearly if you UPVOTE (agree), DOWNVOTE (disagree), or ABSTAIN (change previous vote to undecided).
VOTING RULES (MANDATORY):  
- You can only ABSTAIN on a paragraph where your current 'own vote' is already +1 or -1
